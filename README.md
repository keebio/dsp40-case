# DSP40 40% Keyboard Case
Case files for the [DSP40 40% Keyboard](https://keeb.io/products/dsp40-40-staggered-or-ortholinear-keyboard).

## Plate Files
The DXF files are the plates files for the keyboard. A staggered version and a ortholinear version of the switch plates are provided.

## STL Files
3D printable STL files have been provided for the top shell and middle layer. They are designed to fit with the 1.6mm thick switch plate and bottom plate. The top shell is screwed in from underneath, so you will need [18mm M2 screws](https://keeb.io/products/m2-screws-and-standoffs?variant=39405256147038) for use with it.
